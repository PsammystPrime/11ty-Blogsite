The world of finance in the Cryptocurrency Industry and Blockchain Technology is rapidly evolving and growing such that it has become a hot seat for Investment Opportunities. New cryptocurrencies are often launched with the hope of being widely accepted by the decentralized community to appreciate. Various entities often give out airdrops, which are free unsolicited tokens of an asset, to encourage users to continue mining their coins and for the overall growth of the project and its community. Whether it is safe to invest in cryptocurrency and which assets to stay on the lookout for are set for a later article.

There are lots of coins you can mine, and it can be challenging to remember often the number of coins you have on every platform. This becomes harder when you want to monitor the appreciation or depreciation of all your assets, hence necessitating a wallet. The wallet stores all your cryptos and allows you to perform tasks such as ;  

· Monitoring the performance of your coins

· Purchase of new or more coins

· Selling your coins

· Receiving coins

· Sending Coins

The entire purpose of a crypto wallet can be summed up in three words: Managing your Cryptos. In this context, purchasing and receiving coins may seem synonyms, but they slightly differ. On purchase, it matches you with potential sellers on the wallet for the token you’re looking to acquire while receiving refers to acquiring assets from external sources such as Airdrops claiming, Main-net distribution as a result of mining, or from other users. The same applies to selling and sending assets. Selling is associated with getting matched with potential buyers in the wallet and selling them your token at a particular value. In contrast, sending is associated with transferring tokens to external sources outside your wallet, such as other users or friends.

It’s important to note that the vital distinction in buying and selling is that these transactions;

· Are conducted via an Exchange such as Coinbase, Gemini, Binance, etc. This is to reduce the risks of being a victim of crypto fraud.

· Are not free as crypto exchanges charge trading fees in the form of gas fees on the Ethereum Platform and transaction fees on the Binance Smart Chain. These charges vary from one platform to another.
